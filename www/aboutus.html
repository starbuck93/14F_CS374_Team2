<strong>
    I wanna be the very best, <br />
    Like no one ever was. <br />
    To catch them is my real test, <br />
    To train them is my cause. <br />
<br />
    I will travel across the land, <br />
    Searching far and wide. <br />
    Each Pokemon to understand <br />
    The power that's inside <br />
<br />
    Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) its you and me <br />
    I know its my destiny <br />
    Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend <br />
    In a world we must defend <br />
<br />
    Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) a heart so true <br />
    Our courage will pull us through <br />
    You teach me and I'll teach you <br />
    (Po-ke-mon) Gotta catch 'em all <br />
