#Course Conflict Calculator
## Fall, 2014, Software Engineering, CS 374, Team 2
###Description
This is a documented project for our class, Software Engineering, taught by Dr. Brent Reeves. 

The final product is a course conflicts calculator when given an input of the section number (CRN), a new time for the section to meet at and optionally a new day for the section to meet at, the output is a list of conflicts sorted by seniority.

We have used LaTex for documentation, a LAMP server for the web-end which is live [here](http://14fse.starbuckstech.com), plenty of PHP for the formatting and AJAX side, and a MySQL server to calculate conflicts and host the student-seciton data.
