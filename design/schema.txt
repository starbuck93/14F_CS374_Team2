B. Relationships

        - We define the relationships between entities in this section.
        - 'Intersection Data' includes entities that function to relate different
entities and is not a direct entity to be related in and of itself.
        - The HAS MANY relationship implies 'one or more'. The HAS A
relationship implies 'only one'.

Entity List:
 student
 professor
 course
 office-hours
