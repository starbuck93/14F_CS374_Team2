Intro.

        - Here we propose an API for managing database objects.
        - This API will be written in PHP.
        - We stay away from describing any HTML related output tasks. We design
these APIs to output primitive (integer, string, and array of primitive) data
types.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Database access

We will encapsulate database connection and querying in a class that will serve
as a base to classes representing each kind of entity stored in the database.
This will help streamline database access and allow for easier coding of later
functionality. Each of these subclasses will support retrieving a pre-existing
object from the database or creating a new one.

DatabaseObject
--------------
c-stor()

abstract create(/*variable argument list*/)        --create from variable input data; constructor will invoke this potentially; can init default
abstract create_from_key($primary_key)             --create object from primary-key (in other words, make a database query)
abstract create_from_row($row_description)         --create object from various fields (row description: '$field=$value')
static protected connection                        --connection object shared between all instances
static protected query($query_string)              --perform database query

Student extends DatabaseObject
------------------------------
first_name()
last_name()
middle_initial()
classification()
hours()
array get_courses()

Professor extends DatabaseObject
--------------------------------
first_name()
middle_initial()
last_name()
array get_office_hours()                --might have multiple office-hour sessions

Course extends DatabaseObject
-----------------------------
department()
number()
title()
full_title()                    --department() . " " . number() . " " . title()
time()
duration()
day_of_week()
room()                          --retrieve actual room object, not just id
ConflictDescription compute_conflicts($course)      --maybe make this take '$changeTime' as parameter
array get_students()

**note: compute conflicts finds raw conflict information in the form of a 'ConflictDescription' object

OfficeHours extends DatabaseObject
----------------------------------
time()
duration()
day_of_week()
room()
get_professor()

Building extends DatabaseObject
-------------------------------
name()
name_abbrv()                    --abbreviated name

Room extends DatabaseObject
---------------------------
number()
building()
has_lab()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. Conflicts API

   - The conflicts API will be used to implement the algorithms needed to compute
course time-change conflicts. There is a 'compute_conflicts()' method bound to any
course object. It returns an object of type 'ConflictDescription' which can be used
to describe course conflicts and perform computations based on conflict information.

   - This object is primarily used to analyze conflicts, not find them (that has already
been accomplished at this point).

   - Any 'ConflictDescription' contains conflict information stored as a list of students,
each with a set of conflicting courses. Most likely the set of conflicting courses will 
contain only 1 course, however it is possible that it contain more than one.

ConflictDescription
-------------------
[impl]
$course                 --course being altered
$changeTime             --information about course time change
$changeDuration
$flicts = array(array($student,$course)[, ...])         --store students and conflicting courses; there might be more than one conflict per instance; such
[interface]                                                     as when the move time overlaps more than one conflicting course
count()               --retrieve number of conflicts
student_exists($student) --does the specified student have a conflict (exists in the ConflictDescription)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Optimizations

   Sometimes a batch of database entities is required for some operation. In this
case it is efficient to limit the number of database queries. At other times,
it is efficient to make a query that extracts multiple objects at once across
multiple tables. This may involve extracting a partial object (customized).
   We provide APIs for accomplishing these batch/custom queries.

function BatchQuery($query, array $typeList); // creates row_description strings to create DatabaseObjects
