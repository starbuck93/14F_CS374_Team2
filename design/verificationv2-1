The verification of our project will include the following procedures:
Black-box testing
Module Testing
Integration Testing
System Testing
Acceptance Testing
performance Testing
User Testing
Status Reports

These are the ways with which we will implement the aforementioned procedures.

Black Box Testing
	We will use the testing framework Cucumber for testing all site-related functionality. cucumber can check for expected outputs when given an input or set of inputs. Using Cucumber will allow comprehensive, automated testing of our files. 

Module Testing
	We will give a complete module inputs and test the output with Cucmber, using the actual classes/functionality of our final product

Integration Testing
	This project will implement a bottom-up incremental testing approach, testing lower-level classes with drivers before testing against the actual module that contains the lower-level classes, using Cucmber.

System Testing
	This project will have tests that run over the entire system, simulating input from a user and testing against the expected output.

Acceptance Testing
	our team will schedule a time with the customer to have the customer use our product and decide if it meets the criteria set out for it.

Performance Testing
	Our team is reserching the possibility of testing code complexity using a php framework called "PHP Depend". We will use a built-in php method for measuring response time from the cURL library.

GOMS test
	Our team will predict the actions a user will carry out and estimate the time to execute those, and then measure how long a user takes to complete the task and compare that to our predictions.

Also, status reports are made weekly to record the work that is done each week and how the team is performing.
