\section{Requirements} \label{sec:reqs}

Our Schedule Conflict Calculator Web application will function as an extension to other academic administration technologies. Given
a set of inputs related to moving a course from one time block to another, the application determines the number of student
scheduling conflicts that would arise in some number of move scenarios. The application handles a number of different move
scenarios, allowing the user to decide which scenario to test.

\section{Use Cases and Scenarios} \label{sec:scenes}

The user is allowed multiple scenarios for calculating schedule conflicts. For example, sometimes the user has a single section-change
description in mind and would like to see scheduling conflicts. In other instances, a user might know that they need to move a section
to another time and/or room, yet would like to know which room out of a set of possible candidates has the least number of conflicts.

\end{figure}

In the simple case, we consider a single section-change description supplied with a desired input section. Output will consist of the
number of conflicts as well as a detailed look at individual conflicts. Other input parameters might be needed to provide a more 
customized operation tailored to user needs.

\end{figure}

Other scenarios are needed for more complex operations. A user might wish to provide a set of section-change descriptions to apply to
the input course in order to find the best change time. This set of descriptions may encompass multiple rooms and buildings and also
take into consideration moving courses within the set of section-change descriptions.

\section{Data Flow} \label{sec:dataflow}

This section describes the interaction of various modules within our application. We map the flow of data through the different
modules of the application, demonstrating how it is used and transformed.
