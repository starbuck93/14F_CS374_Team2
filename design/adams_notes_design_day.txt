• How many conflicts for students enrolled and if we can move them
• Is there already classes in certain rooms that we're trying to move it to?
• Priority of student classification
• Input student information, input desired time slot to change class >>> number of conflicts between the students
• Authentication method
	
1. Classification
2. Class it conflicts with, make sure its not last chance to change it
	a. If the class isn't important then it doesn't matter as much
	
We could use misfits for alternate times that don't have many classes offered

Possibly move more than one class around to make another with less conflicts

Depends on the classroom size, so the classroom could change if the size is correct and maybe teach in a Lab

Smallest conflicts is the best result
