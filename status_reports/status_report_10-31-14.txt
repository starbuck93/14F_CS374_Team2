Labor:
--------------------
Adam: 
Ethan: 
Jonathan: Met with Adam to make verification-alpha match given rubric, made basic text file of verificationv2-1.
Rodger: Verification-Alpha; LaTex-ified verificationv2-1; will plant some cucs for SQL testing

Adam, Jonathan, and Rodger did most of spec beta
--------------------------------------------------------
Meetings:
    [Oct 30; 7-9 PM] Adam and Jonathan met to discuss verification tools and produce
verificationv2-1 text document
--------------------------------------------------------
TODO list:
    - implement query functionality for project
    - implement simple data handler
        - think about complex data handler implementation
    - create a test-banner database for Cucumbering
        - create tables that match the schema in project design
        - make up enough data to chop up in a nice Cucumber salad
    - write drivers/features to test querying functionality
        - write some drivers that require db connection
        - write other drivers that do NOT require db connection (so that testing
can be done on local machines that cannot establish db connection)
    - write drivers/features for simple data handler functionality
        - write some drivers with db connection and others without
    - create an 'out' subdirectory in the repo root; send current
cucumber output to text files in this subdirectory (this is important
since we will only be able to run some features from the prod/testing server)
